    <h1>Building Segmentation with Deep Learning</h1>
    <p>
        This project focuses on building segmentation using deep learning techniques. 
        It demonstrates how to train and evaluate a model to detect building boundaries 
        and generate corresponding masks, particularly for satellite imagery. 
        Prepared in Jupyter Notebook format, the project covers the following aspects:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Data preprocessing and image processing techniques</li>
        <li>Building segmentation using models such as U-Net</li>
        <li>Preparing training and testing datasets</li>
        <li>Tuning training parameters</li>
        <li>Evaluating model performance using relevant metrics</li>
    </ul>
